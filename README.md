## LeetCode Challenges

LeetCode offers a lot of challenges that are often asked by large companies such as Google or Microsoft. Working on LeetCode challenges is a great way to practice applying algorithms & data structures concepts to some fun challenges.

### 1. TWO SUM [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### 2. ADD TWO NUMBERS [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### 4. 3Sum [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j, i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### 5. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, `return 0`.

### 6. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**_Note:_** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### 7. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
